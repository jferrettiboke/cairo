Introducing Cairo. A React.js Design System with an auto-generated Design System from your specs.

Make all your components look like how you want, let Cairo handles the rest for you, including functionality, accessibility, API design, auto-generated code with TypeScript support, and many more. Superior DX and UX.

Try it today, and build consistent, themeable, type-safe, accessible React apps and websites with ease, confidence, and speed.

## Features
