# Design System

## Why

I make products, and it is tedious to write and maintain components across products. Having one central design system improves the workflow.

- Build products and iterate faster
- Waste less time maintaining design systems for each product
- Be more productive
- Keep consistency across products
- User experience: ensuring great UX to the end user
- Accessibility: ensuring content is usable by and for everyone
- Performance: ensuring fast load times for the end user
- Developer experience: ensuring superior DX

## Features

### For the end user

- Light/dark mode
- Beautiful built-in animations
- Content loaders to create placeholder loadings

### For developers

- Great API design
- Type-safe
- Easy customization

## Future plans

I have plans for the future to make this design system easy to integrate and customize by others. So you can also build products faster.
