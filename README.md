## Description

Cairo helps you generate a production-ready React.js component library from your specs, with a command.

Build consistent, themeable, type-safe, accessible React apps and websites with ease, confidence, and speed.

Make all your components look like how you want, let Cairo handles the rest, including functionality, accessibility, API design, auto-generated code with TypeScript support, and many more. Superior DX and UX. Always.

## Features
