# Design System

## Why

I make products, and it is tedious to write and maintain components across products. Having one central design system improves the workflow.

- Build products and iterate faster
- Waste less time maintaining design systems across products
- Keep consistency across products
- Accessibility: ensuring content is usable by and for everyone
- Performance: ensuring fast load times for the end user
- Improve developer experience (high code quality, great API design, composition, type-safe, themes, etc)

## Future plans

I have plans for the future to make this design system easy to integrate and customize by others. So you can also build products faster.
